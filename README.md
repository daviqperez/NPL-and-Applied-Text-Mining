# NPL-and-Applied-Text-Mining

This repository contain the assignments and main insights of the course Applied Text Mining in Python. 

This course introduced  text mining and text manipulation basics. The course began with an understanding of how text is handled by python, the structure of text both to the machine and to humans, and an overview of the nltk framework for manipulating text. The second week focused on common manipulation needs, including regular expressions (searching for text), cleaning text, and preparing text for use by machine learning processes. The third week was applying basic natural language processing methods to text, and demonstrating how text classification is accomplished. The final week was to explore more advanced methods for detecting the topics in documents and grouping them by similarity (topic modeling).
